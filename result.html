        <h4>Hey! Before you leave, please read these tips & tricks against Phishing:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In case you receive an odd email, or find yourself in a situation where you're unsure whether someone is trying to attack you: Before clicking any link, pause and hover your mouse over it to
            reveal the true web address. When in doubt try to compare the URL with the official URL (you can always google whatever company/authority trying to contact you). This way, you'll catch the Phisher way before any damage could happen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carefully examine the sender's email address for typos or odd characters. A lot of times the Phishers email address will be a random combination of numbers and letters or maybe even a random name. In those cases reporting or ignoring the email is the best thing to do!
          </li>
          <li>
            Never give out passwords or security codes via email or phone. No legitimate company will ever call you and ask for any passwords or security codes. If you ever find youself in a situation like this, the best thing to do is to hang up and report it!
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your software up to date and use antivirus protection. This is overall the best general approach to staying clear of phishing attacks happening to you. Antivirus programs can help detect and block malicious links, attachments, and fake websites before you interact with them. They act as a safety net â€” even if you accidentally click something suspicious, your antivirus may catch it in time.
