          ...and unfortunately, many people fall victim to them. But what if you could learn to spot the tricks before it's too late?<br /><br />
          Phishing is a type of cyberattack where scammers trick people into
          revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers,
          or personal data. They often disguise themselves as trustworthy
          sources, like banks, social media platforms, or government agencies,
          to manipulate victims into clicking malicious links or downloading
          harmful attachments. Once acquired, the information is used for
          malicious purposes such as identity theft, ransomware attack, credit
          card fraud and more.
